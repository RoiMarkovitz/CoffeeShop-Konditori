# CoffeeShop-Konditori
The program was created as a group idea for a project in the course "Workshop in object-oriented programming and language  C++" at the academy.

At the start of the course we were divided into groups of 3 persons.

The project is divided into 4 parts, each based on its predecessor. 

### Part1a
We were asked to define the "world problem" that contains at least the following programming components:
- 10 classes.
- 3 inheritances, at least one multiple.
- 2 classes with dynamic allocations.
- 2 classes which contain other classes.
- 2 classes with arrays.
- At least 5 operators in addition to the '=' operator.
- 8 operations in main.
- Description and class diagram which explain the idea (You can see the document and diagram in the folder "part1a").

### Part1b
In this part we were aksed to write the main and the header files based on part1a.

### Part2
In this part we were aksed to choose a project of another group and continue the work from there.
We had to implement all the missing code so that the project will not collapse, pass linker stage and will run and work well without bugs.
We chose a project named "Konditori" and had to continue their project based on Part1b. 

### Part3
In this part we were aksed to make another version of part2, with the following elements:
- Implement a general linked list using templates. should only support adding an element to the end, deleting an element and printing elements.
- Use the created list in the previous section to replace one of the arrays defined in the code.
- Replace all fields of type char * dynamically assigned in the string class.
- Replace the use of arrays to use the vector of the STL.
- Following this change, all threes (copy c'tor, d'tor and placement operator) which are not needed anymore had to be deleted from the project.
